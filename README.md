Quick code to log all keystrokes, mouse clicks, and window changes

I have this issue where when I'm playing a game my game will somehow randomly be minimized or paused because something on my PC is either clicking off-screen or something,
so I made this to try and help me figure out what is happening

update (2 hours later):
it worked and found the culprit which was an old printer software (now uninstalled). 
I ended up printing out the keystrokes and mouse clicks to the output log and just writing the Windows changes to the log.txt since it was crashing from too many logs
